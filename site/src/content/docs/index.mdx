## Start Here

New to production OpenClaw? Pick your pain point:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="I need security NOW" icon="warning">
    1. [Gateway Hardening](/patterns/security/gateway-hardening/) — lock down the network
    2. [Tool Policy Lockdown](/patterns/security/tool-policy-lockdown/) — least-privilege access
    3. [Prompt Injection Defense](/patterns/security/prompt-injection-defense/) — authority model
    4. [Native Guardrails](/patterns/security/native-guardrails-integration/) — layer with system defenses
  </Card>
  <Card title="My agent loses context" icon="document">
    1. [Pre-Compaction Flush](/patterns/memory/pre-compaction-memory-flush/) — save state before compaction
    2. [Compaction Strategy](/patterns/context/compaction-strategy-for-24-7-agents/) — optimize when and how
    3. [Window Budget](/patterns/context/window-budget-management/) — allocate tokens wisely
  </Card>
  <Card title="This costs too much" icon="setting">
    1. [Cheap Model Coordinator](/patterns/operations/cheap-model-coordinator/) — biggest savings (70-80%)
    2. [Cost Optimization](/patterns/operations/cost-optimization-strategies/) — 7 strategies ranked
    3. [Heartbeat Design](/patterns/operations/heartbeat-checklist-design/) — stop wasting on checks
  </Card>

## How It Works

Every pattern follows the same structure:

1. **Problem** — what this solves (have you experienced this?)
2. **Context** — when to use / when NOT to use
3. **Implementation** — copy-paste `SOUL.md`, `openclaw.json`, `HEARTBEAT.md` configs
4. **Failure Modes** — what can still go wrong + mitigations
5. **Test Harness** — bash script to validate your setup
6. **Evidence** — real metrics from production use

Patterns are tested against **OpenClaw v2026.2+**. Check the [Version Matrix](/reference/version-matrix/) for compatibility.
